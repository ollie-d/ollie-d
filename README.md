Hey I'm Ollie. I'm a PhD candidate at UCSD working with Dr. Virgnia de Sa on brain computer interfaces (BCIs). I primarily do EEG-based research, specifically event-related brain potential (ERP) work. I'm particularly interested in utilizing complex tasks such as video games for cognitive neuroscience research. I also make a lot of games, music, and CAD files and try to share things with the public when possible!
